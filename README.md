Generating a Password
Set Password Length

Enter the desired password length in the "Password Length" field (default is 12).
Select Character Types

Uppercase (A-Z): Include uppercase letters.
Lowercase (a-z): Include lowercase letters.
Digits (0-9): Include numerical digits.
Symbols (!@#...): Include special characters.
Generate Password

Click the "Generate Password" button.
The generated password will appear in the "Generated Password" field and be automatically copied to your clipboard.
A confirmation message will notify you of the successful copy action.
Setting a Hotkey
Enter Hotkey Combination

In the "Set Hotkey" field, enter your desired hotkey combination (e.g., ctrl+shift+p).
Apply Hotkey

Click the "Set Hotkey" button.
A confirmation message will indicate that the hotkey has been set.
Pressing the configured hotkey anywhere in your system will generate a new password and copy it to the clipboard.
Note: The keyboard library may require administrative privileges to listen for global hotkeys, especially on Windows. If you encounter permission issues, try running the script with elevated privileges.

Customization
Feel free to modify the script to better suit your needs. Possible enhancements include:

Password Strength Meter: Add a feature to assess and display the strength of the generated password.
Password History: Implement a history log to keep track of previously generated passwords.
Character Exclusions: Provide options to exclude similar-looking characters (e.g., l, 1, O, 0) to avoid confusion.
Integration with Password Managers: Extend functionality to integrate with popular password managers for secure storage.
